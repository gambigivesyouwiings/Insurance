              <h3> What is a 529 plan?</h3>
              <p>A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to help pay for education. Originally limited to
                  post-secondary education costs, it was expanded to cover K–12 education in 2017 and apprenticeship
                  programs in 2019. After the
                  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-secure-act-how-affect-retirement-4692743" target="_blank">
                      Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act)</a>
                  and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/secure-2-0-definition-5225115" target="_blank">SECURE 2.0 of 2022</a>,
                  529s can also be used to pay off student loans and fund a <a href="{{url_for('ira')}}">Roth IRA</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                 The two major types of 529 plans are education savings plans and prepaid tuition plans.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Education savings plans grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free if they're used for qualified
                  education expenses. Prepaid tuition plans allow the account owner to pay current tuition rates for
                  future attendance at designated colleges and universities. That means that, most likely, you can lock
                  in a lower cost of college attendance.
              </p>
              <h3> Can I use my Permanent Life Insurance to finance kids' college?</h3>
              <p>
                  Yes! <a href="{{url_for('life_insurance')}}">Permanent life insurance</a> is a type of policy that has
                  a cash value component that grows tax-deferred over time. You can use this cash value to help pay for
                  college expenses by borrowing against it or withdrawing from it. However, there are some pros and cons
                  of using permanent life insurance for college funding.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Some pros are:
                  </p>
              <ol>
                  <li><b>Flexibility:</b> You can use the cash value for any purpose, not just education-related expenses.
                      You can also choose how much and when to withdraw or borrow from it</li>
                  <li><b>Tax benefits:</b> The cash value grows tax-deferred and the withdrawals or loans are usually
                      tax-free, as long as they don’t exceed the premiums paid. You may also qualify for a tax deduction
                      on the interest paid on the policy loans.</li>
                  <li><b>Financial aid</b>: The cash value of a permanent life insurance policy is not considered an
                      asset when applying for federal financial aid, unlike a 529 plan. This may increase your
                      eligibility for grants and scholarships.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                  The cons include:
              </p>
                  <ol>
                      <li> <b>Cost</b>: Permanent life insurance policies are typically more expensive than term life
                          policies or 529 plans. You have to pay for the insurance coverage, the fees, and the
                          commissions. This may reduce the amount of money available for college savings.</li>
                      <li> <b>Risk:</b> If you withdraw or borrow too much from the cash value, you may reduce the death
                          benefit or lapse the policy. This may leave your beneficiaries without adequate protection or
                          trigger a tax liability.</li>
                    <li> <b>Returns:</b> The returns on the cash value may vary depending on the type of policy.
                        You may earn less than what you would with a 529 plan or other investments</li>
                  </ol>

                    <p class="fst-italic">There are no limits on how much you can contribute to a 529 account each year.
                        However, many states put a cap on how much you can contribute in total. Those limits recently
                        ranged from $235,000 to $575,000
                        <a href="https://www.collegesavings.org/find-my-states-529-plan" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>
                    </p>
                      <p>Although 529 plans take their name from Section 529 of the federal tax code,
                          the plans themselves are administered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
                          <br>
                          Anyone can open a 529 account, but they are typically established by parents or grandparents
                          on behalf of a child or grandchild, who is the account's beneficiary. In some states, the person
                          who funds the account may be eligible for a state tax deduction for their contributions.
                          <br>
                        The money in a 529 plan grows on a tax-deferred basis until it is withdrawn. What's more, so
                          long as the money is used for qualified education expenses as defined by the Internal Revenue
                          Service (IRS), those withdrawals aren't subject to either state or federal taxes. In addition,
                          some states may offer tax deductions on contributions.
                          <br>
                        In the case of K–12 students, tax-free withdrawals are limited to $10,000 per year.
                          <br>
                        Since tax benefits vary depending on the state, it's important that you check the details of any
                          529 plan to understand the specific tax benefits that you may or may not be entitled to.

                    <h3>Types of 529 plans</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">The two main types of 529 plans have some significant differences.</p>
                      <h4>Educational Saving Plan</h4>
                      <p>529 savings plans are the more common type. The account holder contributes money to the plan.
                          That money is invested in a preset selection of investment options.
                        <br>
                        Account holders can choose the investment (usually mutual funds) that they want to invest in.
                          How those investments perform will determine how much the account value grows over time.
                        <br>
                        Many 529 plans offer target-date funds, which adjust their assets as the years go by, becoming
                          more conservative as the beneficiary gets closer to college age.
                        <br>
                        Withdrawals from a 529 savings plan can be used for both college and K–12 qualified expenses.
                          Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, room and board, and related costs.
                          <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/introduction-529-plans" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
                        <br>
                        The SECURE Act of 2019 expanded tax-free 529 plan withdrawals to include registered apprenticeship
                          program expenses and up to $10,000 in student loan debt repayment for both account
                          beneficiaries and their siblings.
                          <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1994/text" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>
                        <br>
                        The SECURE Act of 2022, passed as part of the 2023 Omnibus funding bill, permits rolling over up
                          to $35,000 of unspent funds in a 529 account into a Roth IRA account. To qualify, the account
                          must be at least 15 years old.
                          <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/text" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>

                      </p>
                      <h4>Prepaid Tuition Plan</h4>
                      <p>
                          Prepaid tuition plans are offered by a limited number of states and some higher education
                          institutions. They vary in their specifics, but the general principle is that they allow you to
                          lock in tuition at current rates for a student who may not be attending college for years to
                          come. Prepaid plans are not available for K–12 education.
                          <br>
                          As with 529 savings plans, prepaid tuition plans grow in value over time. Eventual withdrawals
                          from the account used to pay tuition are not taxable. However, unlike savings plans, prepaid
                          tuition plans do not cover the costs of room and board.
                          <br>
                          Prepaid tuition plans may place a restriction on which colleges they may be used for. The money
                          in a savings plan, by contrast, can be used at almost any eligible institution.
                          <br>
                          In addition, the money paid into a prepaid tuition plan isn't guaranteed by the federal government and may not be guaranteed by some states.

                          Be sure you understand all aspects of the prepaid tuition plan before you utilize one.

                    <p class="fst-italic">Withdrawals from a 529 plan are exempt from federal and state income taxes,
                        provided the money is used for qualified educational expenses.
                        <br>
                        Any other withdrawals are subject to taxes plus a 10% penalty, with exceptions for certain
                        circumstances, such as death or disability.

                        <br>
                        The money you contribute to a 529 plan isn't tax-deductible for federal income tax purposes.
                        However, more than 30 states provide tax deductions or credits of varying amounts for
                        contributions to a 529 plan.

                        <br>
                        In general, you'll need to invest in your home state's plan if you want a state tax deduction or
                        credit. If you're willing to forgo a tax break, some states will allow you to invest in their
                        plans as a non-resident.

                        (Section 529).

                          You may transfer the plan to another family member, who is defined as:
