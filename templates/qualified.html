              <p>One of the benefits of owning a business is that you have tax-favored options to save for retirement
                  that non-business owners donâ€™t have. Your business can sponsor a qualified plan which may be designed
                  to drive the majority of the benefits to you. This is a classic way to shift business dollars to you
                  for retirement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  With <b>defined contribution plans</b>, you define how much money you want to contribute to the plan. What is
                  available for retirement will depend on the contributions actually made and the earnings on those contributions.
                  With <b>defined benefit plans</b>, your retirement benefit is defined under the plan. (For example 75% of the highest five
                  consecutive years' salary over the last 10 years.) The contribution amount will be based on a number
                  of factors, including the benefit being promised, the number of years until retirement and an interest
                  rate assumption.
              </p>
              <p>Benefits of a qualified plan include:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Contributions to the plan are tax-deductible to the business.</li>
                  <li>Contributions are not currently taxable to the participants.</li>
                  <li>Earnings on contributions grow tax deferred.</li>
                  <li>Contributions made on behalf of employees can be paid with dollars that would have otherwise been spent on taxes.</li>
                  <li>Qualified plans are protected from creditors</li>
                  <li>Provides a valuable benefit to employees and helps to attract and retain employees.</li>
                  <li>Taxation of benefits are deferred until taken in the future.</li>

                    <p class="fst-italic">A SIMPLE IRA plan (Savings Incentive Match PLan for Employees) allows employees
                        and employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees. It is ideally suited as a
                        start-up retirement savings plan for small employers not currently sponsoring a retirement plan.
                    </p>
                       <p> SIMPLE IRA plans can provide a significant source of income at retirement by allowing employers
                           and employees to set aside money in retirement accounts. SIMPLE IRA plans do not have the
                           start-up and operating costs of a conventional retirement plan.</p>

                          <li>Under the "non-elective" contribution formula, even if an eligible employee doesn't contribute
                              to his or her SIMPLE IRA, that employee must still receive an employer contribution to his

                      </ol>
                      <h3>Example of how a Simple IRA works:</h3>
                      <p><b>Example 1</b>:<br>
Elizabeth works for the Rockland Quarry Company, a small business with 50 employees. Rockland has decided to establish a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees and will match its employees' contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 3% of each employee's compensation. Under this option, if a Rockland employee does not contribute to his or her SIMPLE IRA, then that employee does not receive any matching employer contribution.

Elizabeth has a yearly compensation of $50,000 and contributes 5% of her compensation ($2,500) to her SIMPLE IRA. The Rockland matching contribution is $1,500 (3% of $50,000). Therefore, the total contribution to Elizabeth's SIMPLE IRA that year is $4,000 (her $2,500 contribution plus Rockland's $1,500 contribution). The financial institution holding Elizabeth's SIMPLE IRA has several investment choices, and she is free to choose which ones suit her best.

<br><b>Example 2</b>:<br>
Austin works for the Skidmore Tire Company, a small business with 75 employees. Skidmore has a SIMPLE IRA plan for its employees and will make a 2% nonelective contribution for each of them. Under this option, even if a Skidmore employee does not contribute to his or her SIMPLE IRA, that employee would still receive an employer contribution to his or her SIMPLE IRA equal to 2% of compensation.

Austin's annual compensation is $40,000. Even if Austin does not contribute this year, Skidmore must still make a contribution of $800 (2% of $40,000).</p>

                        employees. In fact, IRS rules say you canâ€™t contribute to a solo 401(k) if you have full-time
                        employees, though you can use the plan to cover both you and your spouse.
                    </p>
                       <p>This arrangement is appropriate where the business entity will continue to operate for a
                           long period, at least long enough to pay the benefits promised under the arrangement.
                           Essentially, the business promises to pay a benefit to the executive at some time in the
                           future (often at retirement age).

                      <h4>Solo 401(k) contribution limits</h4><p>The total solo 401(k) contribution limit is up to $69,000 in 2024. There is a catch-up contribution of an extra $7,500 for those 50 or older.
                          <br><br>To understand solo 401(k) contribution rules, you want to think of yourself as two people: an employer (of yourself) and an employee (yes, also of yourself). Within that overall $69,000 in 2024, your contributions are subject to additional limits in each role::</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>As the employee, you can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024, or 100% of compensation, whichever is less. Those 50 or older get to contribute an additional $7,500.
                          </li>
                          <li>As the employer, you can make an additional profit-sharing contribution of up to 25% of your compensation or net self-employment income, which is your net profit less half your self-employment tax and the plan contributions you made for yourself.
                          </li>
                          <li>The limit on compensation that can be used to factor your contribution is $345,000 in 2024. These contributions need to be made by the tax filing deadline or extension, if applicable.
                          </li>
                          <li>Keep in mind that if youâ€™re side-gigging, employee 401(k) limits apply by person, rather than by plan. That means if youâ€™re also participating in a 401(k) at your day job, the limit applies to contributions across all plans, not each individual plan.
                          </li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>The nice thing about a solo 401(k) is you get to pick your tax advantage: You can opt for the traditional 401(k), under which contributions reduce your income in the year they are made. In that case, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. The alternative is the Roth solo 401(k), which offers no initial tax break but allows you to take distributions in retirement tax-free.</p>

                    <h3>Qualified Benefit Plan</h3>
                      <p class="fst-italic">A defined benefit plan, more commonly known as a pension, offers guaranteed retirement benefits for employees. Defined benefit plans are largely funded by employers, with retirement payouts based on a set formula that considers an employeeâ€™s salary, age and tenure with the company.
                      </p>
                      <p>Defined benefit plans offer guaranteed salary-like payments and were historically offered in order to entice workers to stay with one company for years or even decades.
                      <br>
                      The IRS considers a defined benefit plan to be a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan. That makes them eligible for benefits like tax-deferred investment growth and tax deductions for certain contributions.
                      <br>
                      Youâ€™re probably more familiar with qualified employer-sponsored options like a 401(k) plan. Unlike 401(k)s, defined benefit plans are usually funded entirely by employer contributions, although in rare cases employees may be required to make some contributions.
                      <br>
                      </p>
                      <h4>How are pension benefits calculated?</h4>
                      <p>The retirement benefits provided by a defined benefit plan are typically based on some kind of formula that considers factors like your time with the company, your salary and your age.
                        <br>
                      For instance, a company might offer an annual payout equal to 1.5% of your average salary over the final five years of your employment for each year you were with the company. If the latter amounted to 20 years, then you might see an annual benefit equal to 30% of your salary.
                      <br>
                    Itâ€™s important to note that there is no single method defined benefit plans use to calculate employee benefits.
                    <br>
                    The formula might be based on an employeeâ€™s average salary for their last three years with a companyâ€”or their last five years. It might also be based on the employeeâ€™s average salary for their whole career with a companyâ€”or there might be a flat dollar benefit, such as $800 for each year an employee has been with the firm.
