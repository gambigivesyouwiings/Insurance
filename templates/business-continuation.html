              <p>Have you taken the steps to ensure that your business will continue to run smoothly if you were to lose
                  a business partner? Have you considered what will happen in the event of divorce, disability or even
                  worse, death?

                  A buy-sell agreement can establish the value of the business, assure that there is a buyer for the
                  business and improve creditworthiness of the business. Think of a buy-sell agreement as a formal exit
                  strategy that ensures everyone is treated fairly, the business is in a position to continue and the
                  family is well cared for.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  With a buy sell agreement, the business owners enter into the agreement today that sets out the terms
                  and conditions of the sale of their business interest at some point in the future.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  These terms and conditions may include (but are not limited to) who will purchase the interest, what
                  triggers the buyout, when the sale will take place, the value of the interest, how the purchase price will be paid and more.

                      <p class="fst-italic">If someone walked into your office today and wanted to buy your business,
                          how much would you ask for? If one of your co-owners wanted to leave the business, how much
                          would you pay for their interest in the business?
                      </p>
                      <p> These questions are just the beginning of the exploration into the valuation of your business.
                          Business valuation is sometimes part art and sometimes part science. The science may involve
                          valuation methods that range from simple to fairly complex formulas.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          A business valuation is a vital part of your business continuation plan. There are a number of
                          resources that may be available for you to use, and you should always consult with your own CPA
                          and other advisors.
                          <br>
                          One tool that is available is an online program from BizEquity. This tool will allow you to
                          follow a seven-step program that will help you arrive at a “scientific” valuation. Please note,

                    <p class="fst-italic">Your business structure, who owns the business, your family situation,
                        will influence the choice of which arrangement is best for you.
                    </p>
                       <p> The standard buy-sell agreements include:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li><b>Entity Purchase Agreement (Sometimes called a Stock Redemption Agreement):</b>
                              <br>
                              Under this agreement, the buyer is the business. The business owners agree to sell their
                              ownership interest back to the business if they become disabled or wish to retire. If
                              there is a death of an owner, the owner’s estate is required to sell the deceased owner’s
                              interest back to the business.
                          </li>
                          <li><b>Cross Purchase Agreement:</b>
                              <br>
                            The co-owners will purchase the selling owner’s business interest. The business itself will
                              not be involved in the purchase.
                          </li>
                          <li><b>Wait-and-See Buy-Sell Agreement:</b>
                              <br>
                              This agreement allows the business owners to delay the selection of an entity purchase or
                              a cross-purchase buy-sell agreement until an actual death, disability, retirement or sale
                              of a business interest. The agreement establishes a series of options usually starting with
                              an option for the business to purchase the interest. If the business doesn’t make the
                              purchase then the cross-purchase option is triggered. Many agreements have additional
                              options triggered if the cross-purchase option is not exercised.
                          </li>
                      </ol>
                      <p> Once you determine which agreement is best for your business, your attorney will draft the
                          agreement. The agreement will spell out all the details with some of the key areas being:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>The trigger events (death, disability, retirement, termination, divorce, bankruptcy)</li>
                          <li>Who will purchase the interest (the business, co-owners, key people, third parties)</li>
                          <li>The value of the business (set price, formula).</li>
                          <li>How the price will be paid.</li>
                      </ol>

                    <h3>Funding a Buy-Sell agreement</h3>
                    <p class="fst-italic">Having a formal buy-sell is important, but just as important is making sure
                        the money is there to complete the buy-sell.
                    </p>
                       <p> There are a number of ways to fund a buy-sell agreement:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li><b>Cash on hand</b>
                              <br>
                              Unfortunately, cash (surplus cash!) is not always available when it’s needed most and
                              depending on your business, the amount may be substantial.
                          </li>
                          <li><b>Sinking fund:</b>
                              <br>
                            Think of this as a savings account. With this method, money is set aside for the eventual
                              purchase of the business. It’s a little more certain than hoping to have cash on hand, but
                              what if something happens before the money you need for the buyout has accumulated?
                          </li>
                          <li><b>Borrowed funds or installment note</b>
                              <br>
                              Another option is to borrow funds from a bank or from the selling owner to purchase the
                              business. However, the death, disability or retirement of a co-owner may affect the
                              ability to obtain credit from a third party. Borrowing the money from the seller through
                              an installment note is often used as a back-up plan, when used as a primary method of
                              funding a buyout it raises many concerns. Can the family afford to receive the buyout funds
                              over the installment period? What happens if the business cannot sustain itself with this
                              new debt? Will the family receive the whole buyout price?
                          </li>
                          <li><b>Life Insurance</b>
                              <br>
                              For many business owners, life insurance can be a cost-effective option. The life
                              insurance death benefit can provide the needed cash to complete a purchase at death and
                              the cost to purchase the insurance may only be pennies on a dollar if you qualify.
                              <br><br>
                              For lifetime buyouts in the event of divorce, disability or retirement, the policy cash
                              value can be accessed through loans and withdrawals to supplement funds needed to complete
                              the purchase. Note that the cost and availability of insurance can vary based on age, health
                              and benefit amount. Policy loans and withdrawals reduce the policy's cash value and death
                              benefit and may result in a taxable event.
                              <br><br>
                              Surrender charges may reduce the policy's cash value in early years. Withdrawals up to the
                              basis paid into the contract and loans thereafter will not create an immediate taxable event,
                              but substantial tax ramifications could result upon contract lapse or surrender. Policy
                              loans will be taxed as ordinary income if the policy is allowed to lapse. It is possible
                              that coverage will expire when either no premiums are paid following the initial premium,
                              or subsequent premiums are insufficient to continue coverage.
