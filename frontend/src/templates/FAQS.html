                     It depends, first ask yourself - “is anyone financially dependent on me?” You may not have a spouse
                     who is dependent on you but what about other family members? Even if no one is dependent on you,
                     you may want to consider purchasing life insurance to cover the repayment of debts, taxes, funeral
                     and other final expenses.
                     <br>
                     But before you make a final decision, think to the future. If you get married and have children someday, you may want to have life insurance coverage. If you buy coverage today while you're young and healthy, you'll get much better premium rates than if you wait. Rates increase as you age and if your health deteriorates.

                     You are never too young to plan for your future and an annuity may be a good choice for your
                     long-term savings goals, such as for retirement. The question you need to ask yourself is - “will I
                     need to access the money before I am 59 ½?” Although you can take a distribution from an annuity
                     prior to age 59 ½, the distribution may be subject to a 10% premature distribution penalty. If you
                     think you may need to access this money on a more short term basis, an annuity may not be the right
                     savings vehicle for you.

                     The idea of buying life insurance for your child is something no one wants to consider because it forces us to consider the unthinkable. But purchasing a policy for a child isn't just about having financial protection if the unthinkable happens; it's about ensuring the child's financial future.
<br>
Purchasing a policy also locks in the child's insurability. Usually, children don't have to go through a medical underwriting process - the parents simply answer a few medical questions. As long as the policy remains in force, the child will always have life insurance. Most insurance policies today also offer optional riders that will allow the child to increase their insurance coverage when they reach certain milestones in life.

                     Yes you can. You may have access to policy cash value through either a withdrawal or as a loan from the insurance company using the policy as collateral. If you take a withdrawal, your policy values will immediately be reduced by the withdrawal amount. If you take a loan, depending upon the type of insurance you have, your policy values may continue to grow. You are not required to repay the loan, or the loan interest, during your lifetime. However, if you choose not to, any outstanding loan balance will reduce the amount of death benefit payable to your beneficiary.

                     Annuity and life insurance policy values are not reported on the Free Application For Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Non-Qualified annuities, however, are counted as an asset on the CSS Profile, the other aid form that about 200+ colleges, mostly private, require in addition to the FAFSA when assessing a student’s eligibility for their own institutional financial aid dollars.
<br><br>
More importantly, and as often is the case at most state universities, your income may be too high to qualify for need-based financial aid anyway.
<br><br>
The other benefit of life insurance and annuities for college planning, is the ability to accumulate cash values that can be used to help pay for college costs.
<br><br>
Often annuities are used to fund a Roth IRA and Roths offer the option for a penalty free distribution if used for higher education costs. However, you will need to consider the annuity contract free withdrawal feature and surrender charges when deciding to access your Roth annuity.
<br><br>
You can also take a loan or withdrawal from your life insurance policy - potentially tax-free - to help offset some of the cost of college.

                     You can name any legally competent person as a beneficiary, including your spouse, children, other relative or friend. You can also name an entity as a beneficiary, such as a trust or charity.
<br><br>
The proceeds of your policy will be paid directly to your beneficiary, privately and without the delays of probate. If your needs are more complex, perhaps to take care of an aging parent or a special needs child, you may want to consider utilizing a trust as your beneficiary. The trust will outline the provisions of how the proceeds will be distributed and a trustee of your choosing can be named to manage the proceeds on behalf of the beneficiary.

                     If your insurance protection is Term life, you will have a grace period to make your payment. If by the end of the grace period you have not made a payment, your policy will lapse, and you will no longer have coverage.
<br>
If your insurance protection is permanent life insurance, you will have a grace period to pay your premium plus some additional options. It may be possible that your policy has sufficient cash value to pay the premium from those policy values. Just be aware that using policy values and benefits to pay the premium due will reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit, and may increase the risk of lapsing the policy. If you don't have sufficient cash value to pay the policy premiums, you may have the option to reduce your face amount to a level that doesn’t require a premium payment.
<br>
Most importantly, if you are having trouble making your payment, contact our agent for more options on your policy.

                     It is best if you do not name them as the direct beneficiary because most states require that a guardian be appointed to administer the proceeds payable to the minor child and will result in a time delay in creating the guardianship, and therefore, delay in payment of the benefits and potentially additional costs.
<br><br>
The best thing to do is name a guardian, perhaps your spouse, when you establish your beneficiary designation. Another option may be to establish a trust to receive the insurance proceeds for the benefit of the minor child. Your insurance agent and/or attorney can assist you with the proper beneficiary designation if you have minor children.

                     In many cases, yes, if the ownership of the two policies is the same. You will need to go through new underwriting for the new coverage. To avoid taxation on the cash value in your policy in excess of premiums paid, you will want to consider an exchange under Code Section 1035. 1035 Exchanges allow for a tax-free exchange of one life insurance policy for another. There may be circumstances where replacing one policy for another is suitable for your circumstances, but in most cases we believe that replacing an existing policy for a new one is usually not in your best interests. Work with your agent to get all the facts before making such a decision.

                     Yes, if your annuity was purchased through a qualified account, such as an IRA, 403(b) or 401(K), all payments will be subject to ordinary income taxes. If your annuity was purchased with after-tax dollars, you will receive the earnings first, which are taxable as ordinary income. Once you have received all of your earnings, payments will be made from the premiums you made to policy which are received tax-free. If you purchase an income rider on your annuity, once your account value has been exhausted, you will continue to receive guaranteed payments for life, however, those payments will be received income taxable.

Show your employees that you care through low-cost, high-value employee benefits.

                    The biggest advantage of incorporation is that the business assets of the corporation are separate from your personal finances. As a result, your personal assets generally can be shielded from creditors of the business.
<br><br>
Selecting to be treated as a C Corporation may also allow you, the business owner, to be eligible to participate in certain fringe benefit programs available only to workers classified as employees of the corporation.
<br><br>
To maintain this legal separation you must keep corporate assets separate from personal assets, hold periodic shareholder meetings, and file reports required by various government agencies, including a separate tax return. There is a cost associated with establishing and maintaining corporate formalities, and should be considered before making any decision. You will want to consult with your legal and tax advisor regarding the impact for your business.
<br><br>
When doing business as a C Corporation there are certain tax implications to consider and should be reviewed with your legal and accounting team.It is possible that the Corporate tax bracket may be lower than your personal tax bracket – this may lead to some benefit opportunities. Also, remember that a distribution from the C corporation to you as a shareholder may be treated as a dividend. This is sometimes referred to as double taxation – the earnings were taxed at the corporate level then again as a dividend when received by the shareholder. Whether this results in a higher tax cost than might be available through other business entities will actually depend on the corporate tax rate and the dividend tax rate.
<br><br>
Before deciding to incorporate, you should seek legal and tax advice on what type of ownership best suits your business.

                    The answer is it depends. It depends on what you anticipate your future individual tax rate to be and whether you can put the funds in a tax deferred asset as an alternative to the qualified plan. If you anticipate that your personal tax rate will be lower at retirement, then it may make sense for you to contribute to a qualified plan (and receive a current tax deduction and tax deferred growth). If you think your tax rates will be the same or higher in the future you need to factor in other issues. Determine if you will be able to use the potential tax savings from the contribution to the qualified plan and contribute the tax savings to a tax deferred growth fund. The combination of current tax savings, contributions to the qualified plan and the growth of the tax savings if contributed to a fund, may overcome the ultimate tax cost on withdrawals from the qualified plan.
<br><br>
Work with your tax advisor to see if a qualified plan makes sense for you.

                    Through the use of a so called Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (funny name but that’s what the tax code calls them), you may be able to minimize both income and estate taxes.
<br><br>
By selling the business to the trust, any future appreciation of your business will be removed from your estate.It may be possible for you to receive a stream of payments from the Trust (as payment for the business) which may provide cash flow to you for retirement. Under current tax rules, the sale of the business through an installment note to the grantor trust should not result in taxable gain and the installment payments may also avoid current personal income taxes.

                    Three common methods that are used. The simplest method is the multiple of income method and often a multiple of five or seven is applied. Another method is the cost of replacement method. This method considers such things as expenses to recruit, hire, and train as well as salary. Slightly more complicated is the contribution to earnings method. Your legal or tax advisor can assist you with which method is most appropriate for your business.

                    No. There are no formal requirements to establish an Executive Bonus program. The employee will apply for, and own, the life insurance policy. Your business will pay the premium directly to the insurance company. The premium will be considered as a “non-cash” fringe benefit for withholding purposes and are reported as other compensation on the employee’s W-2, subject to FICA and FUTA.

                    Life insurance policy loans and withdrawals reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit and may result in a taxable event. Surrender charges may reduce the policy's cash value in early years.
